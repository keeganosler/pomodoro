# Pomodoro

This is a simple [Pomodoro Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) timer that also includes colour, font and light/dark theme switching. It was inspired by [this](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/pomodoro-app-KBFnycJ6G) challenge from Frontend Mentor.

This was created using Angular, Angular Material and Boostrap.
